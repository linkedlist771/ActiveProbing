# ActiveProbing
## This project is for the active probing for a homework.


For this homework, we will use the active prob to analyze the 
the regular service and each port the ip address is using.

For vps server like :
- AWS
- Huawei Cloud
- Aliyun
- Tencent Cloud

# IP range for each of the vps provider

## 1. AWS
For aws, it is simple, because the ip range is public.

https://ip-ranges.amazonaws.com/ip-ranges.json


> PS: for the other three I use the 
`https://networksdb.io/`
## 2. Tencent Cloud 

https://networksdb.io/ip-addresses-of/tencent-cloud-computing-beijing-co-ltd


## 3. Aliyun

https://networksdb.io/ip-addresses-of/tencent-cloud-computing-beijing-co-ltd


## 4. Huawei Cloud

https://networksdb.io/ip-addresses-of/huawei-cloud
